## Enhanced Management System Usage

### Unified Command Interface

The enhanced MediaStack provides a single entry point for all operations:

```bash
# Main management interface (recommended)
./mediastack.sh [command] [service]
```

### Core Commands

#### **Initial Setup**
```bash
./mediastack.sh setup           # Create directory structure automatically
./mediastack.sh pull            # Download all Docker images
./mediastack.sh start-all       # Start all services (Gluetun first)
```

#### **Daily Operations**
```bash
./mediastack.sh status          # Show container status with health checks
./mediastack.sh health          # Comprehensive health check with HTTP testing
./mediastack.sh list            # List all available services
./mediastack.sh logs [service]  # View logs for specific service
```

#### **Service Management**
```bash
# Individual service control
./mediastack.sh start [service]    # Start specific service
./mediastack.sh stop [service]     # Stop specific service  
./mediastack.sh restart [service]  # Restart specific service

# Bulk operations
./mediastack.sh start-all          # Start all services (intelligent ordering)
./mediastack.sh stop-all           # Stop all running services
./mediastack.sh restart-all        # Full restart (remove + recreate)
./mediastack.sh remove-all         # Stop and remove all containers
```

#### **Advanced Features**
```bash
./mediastack.sh update          # Update all services to latest images
./mediastack.sh whitelist       # Manage selective service control
./mediastack.sh help            # Show detailed command help
```

### Whitelist-Based Service Management

The enhanced system includes **selective service management** via `services.whitelist`:

```bash
# Enable whitelist mode
echo "prowlarr radarr sonarr jellyfin gluetun" > services.whitelist

# Only whitelisted services will be affected by:
./mediastack.sh start-all       # Starts only whitelisted services
./mediastack.sh restart-all     # Restarts only whitelisted services
```

**Note:** Individual service commands (`start [service]`, `stop [service]`) work on ALL services regardless of whitelist.

## Enhanced Features

### 🎯 **Unified Management System**
- **Single Entry Point:** All operations through one script (`./mediastack.sh`)
- **Comprehensive Commands:** Setup, management, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Intelligent Orchestration:** Smart dependency handling (Gluetun-first startup)

### 🏥 **Advanced Health Monitoring**
- **Real HTTP Health Checks:** Tests actual web service availability (not just ports)
- **Dynamic Port Detection:** Automatically reads ports from `docker-compose.env`
- **Comprehensive Status:** Container status + HTTP accessibility in one view
- **Health Command:** Dedicated health check with detailed reporting

### 🎛️ **Selective Service Control (Whitelist System)**
- **Service Selection:** Control which services are affected by bulk operations
- **Whitelist Configuration:** Simple file-based service selection (`services.whitelist`)
- **Flexible Management:** Individual services always accessible, bulk ops respect whitelist
- **Easy Configuration:** Add/remove services from automated management

### 📁 **Clean Project Organization**  
- **Separated Concerns:** Scripts, compose files, and data in dedicated folders
- **Git-Safe Structure:** Container data and configs excluded from version control
- **Automated Setup:** Directory structure created automatically
- **Environment-Driven:** All paths configurable via `docker-compose.env`

### 🔄 **Smart Container Orchestration**
- **Dependency Awareness:** Gluetun always starts first (VPN network priority)
- **Graceful Operations:** Proper start/stop sequences with error handling
- **Container-Aware Logic:** Works with actual running containers, not just compose files
- **Data Preservation:** Volumes and configurations persist across operations

### ✅ **Code Quality & Reliability**
- **Shellcheck Compliant:** All scripts pass static analysis
- **Proper Error Handling:** Robust error checking with `set -euo pipefail`
- **Quoted Variables:** Protection against path/space issues
- **Exit Code Management:** Proper error propagation (`|| exit 1` on critical commands)

### 🎨 **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Colored Output:** Easy-to-read status messages and progress indicators
- **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive feedback for all operations
- **Help System:** Built-in documentation with `./mediastack.sh help`
- **Progress Feedback:** Clear indication of what the system is doing

## Implementation Details

### **Whitelist System**
The `services.whitelist` file controls which services are affected by bulk operations:

```bash
# Create whitelist with essential services
echo "gluetun prowlarr radarr sonarr jellyfin" > services.whitelist

# Bulk operations now only affect these services:
./mediastack.sh start-all    # Only starts whitelisted services
./mediastack.sh restart-all  # Only restarts whitelisted services

# Individual commands work on ALL services:
./mediastack.sh start plex   # Works regardless of whitelist
```

### **Health Check System**
Enhanced health monitoring with real HTTP testing:

```bash
./mediastack.sh health
# Output example:
# ✅ gluetun: Running (VPN connected)
# ✅ prowlarr: Running + HTTP accessible (http://192.168.1.100:9696)
# ❌ radarr: Running but HTTP not accessible (port 7878)
# ⚠️  jellyfin: Container stopped
```

### **Directory Management**
Automated directory creation with proper permissions:

```bash
./mediastack.sh setup
# Creates complete folder structure from docker-compose.env
# Sets proper ownership and permissions
# Handles Windows line endings in environment files
```

### **Project Migration Benefits**
Advantages of the enhanced structure:

- **📁 Clean Organization:** Container data moved to `data/` folder (gitignored)
- **🔄 Environment-Driven:** All paths from `docker-compose.env` variables
- **🚫 Git Safety:** Sensitive data excluded from version control
- **🛡️ Data Persistence:** Configurations survive container operations
- **🌐 VPN Priority:** Gluetun dependency handling for network security
- **📍 Relocatable:** Easy path changes via environment configuration
